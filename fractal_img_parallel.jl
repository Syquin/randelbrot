    z -> z^2 + c. The number c is in the Mandelbrot set if (f_c)^n(0) 
    does not go to infinity. The below function checks if the orbit 
    goes to infinity by looking up to n steps. If it diverges, it returns
    the number of steps it takes for the point 0 to have an absolute value above 2. 
    The reason to return this value is to color the graph later.
