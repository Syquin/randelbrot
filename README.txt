This software is a growing project to create interesting images and potentially animations of fractals from dynamical systems,
particularly with as little user work as possible. Currently there is built-in functionality for the Mandelbrot set and its corresponding Julia sets,
but greater support is coming soon for the Burning Ship and user-defined fractals. Plans for the future include
procedurally generated animations through Julia sets which are "nearby" in parameter.
