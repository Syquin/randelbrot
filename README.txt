This software is a growing project to create interesting images and potentially animations of fractals from dynamical systems,
particularly with as little user work as possible. Plans for the future include
procedurally generated animations through Julia sets which are "nearby" in parameter.

User creates a FractalSystem of either the Mandelbrot set or Julia set type. System definitions are provided for the Mandelbrot 
and Burning Ship fractals, as well as for their Julia sets in a given parameter. User then creates a 
FractalWindow in which to view the fractal, and may render it with one from a number of different color gradients. Given a 
starting window, the user may zoom procedurally to a chosen depth while stochastically choosing views that should be visually interesting.
